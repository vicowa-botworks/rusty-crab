//! The config seam: `pkg/config`'s loader, its writer, and the pair of files they
//! leave behind.
//!
//! This is the second stored format the port has to stay byte-compatible with, and it
//! has the same shape as the session store: **the artifact is the directory**. One
//! `SaveConfig` writes the JSON document *and* `.security.yml` beside it; one
//! `LoadConfig` of a config below `CurrentVersion` migrates, calls `MakeBackup` and
//! rewrites the user's file in place. A port that treats load as a read misses three
//! things at once -- the backup, the upgrade on disk, and the directory listing -- and
//! a port that writes one plausible file instead of the pair leaves a machine the Go
//! build cannot read back.
//!
//! Three properties carry the whole risk here, and each has its own module:
//!
//! * **the version ladder** ([`load`]): what the loader does before it parses, and in
//!   which order. Two of its branches are bugs, and this crate reproduces both,
//!   because a Rust loader that "fixes" one would accept configs the shipped binary
//!   rejects and the two would then disagree about the same user's directory forever.
//!   See [`BUG_VERSION_PROBE_BEFORE_LENGTH`] and [`BUG_PROVIDERS_SURVIVES_MIGRATION`].
//! * **strictness** ([`schema`]): every JSON decode reflects the target type and
//!   refuses a key it cannot place, at any depth, naming the path. The security file is
//!   the opposite -- decoded by a YAML library that ignores what it does not know -- and
//!   an entry there *replaces* the JSON one rather than merging.
//! * **the pair** ([`yaml`]): `.security.yml` is the yaml-tagged half, which is not the
//!   two sections its struct tags suggest at a glance.
//!
//! ## What is not here
//!
//! `SecureString` is a `String`. Go's type exists so a secret does not print in a log
//! or a `Debug` dump; that is a property of Go's formatting, and the fixture cannot
//! observe it -- the corpus records the loaded config re-marshalled, where a secret is
//! just a string. Recorded in `docs/DIVERGENCES.md` rather than silently skipped.
//!
//! The default config table ([`defaults`]) is data, not behaviour: 30 built-in model
//! entries and the rest of `DefaultConfig()`. It is transcribed from the Go source, and
//! the fixture is what notices when the source moves.

///   environment cleared, so they are inert for every recorded case -- but a real
///   process is not, and this loader would silently differ from Go there.
/// * `InitChannelList`: inferring `type` from the map key, refusing an unregistered
///   type, and the singleton constraints.
/// * `expandMultiKeyModels`: a model with two `api_keys` becomes two entries, the
///   second named `name__key_1`, and the copy carries only the fields the Go function
///   lists -- `enabled` among those it drops.
/// * `ValidateModelList` and `ValidateTurnProfile`.
///
/// The security file *is* read, because leaving it out would load a config whose
/// secrets are in the wrong place; an unimplemented section in it is an error rather
/// than a silent drop.
///
/// A missing file is not an error: Go logs and returns defaults. That is why the return
/// type is not `Option` -- the caller always gets a config, and the only ways to get an
/// `Err` are a document that cannot be parsed, a key that cannot be placed, or a
/// version this build does not know.
///
/// `home` is what `$HOME` expands to. It is a parameter rather than an `env::var` call
/// because the generator pins it (`/home/oracle`) and the fixture pins the expansion
/// byte for byte; reading the real environment here would make the replay depend on the
